### I&#8217;m currently an Operations Manager at Marketing Results, where I help design and build systems to support our clients businesses.

I am also passionate about design, taking time to explore User Experience, and how design can help the world be better. This ties in with my love of psychology, exploring how people think and how they make decisions.

I also enjoy exploring narratives, whether it be watching a TV series, reading a book, or running a game of Dungeons & Dragons.
