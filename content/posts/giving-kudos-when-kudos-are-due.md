title: Giving Kudos When Kudos Are Due

This is something I’ve actually been thinking about for a couple of days…

In a workplace, it’s very common to give a shoutout when a subordinate or a colleague has done something noteworthy. However, shoutouts very rarely go up the business organisational chart.

I guess some people think that giving compliments to a boss seems like sucking up, but I think as long as it is an honest compliment, it’s worth doing.

Sometimes even your boss needs to know that their work is appreciated.
