Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors to ever live, and this video explores why. His understanding of the script allows him to fill in the gaps that the script doesn&#8217;t cover.

If you haven&#8217;t watched Westworld yet, you should. It explores some interesting topics, and the production is amazing. The entire team should be proud of the art they created.
