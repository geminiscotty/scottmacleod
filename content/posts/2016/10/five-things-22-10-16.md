## [Novelist Connie Willis explains why telepathy is a terrible superpower][1]—The Verge

An interesting discussion around Connie Willis’ new book _Crosstalk_, especially around the idea that being able to hear everything that everyone is thinking in their stream of consciousness wouldn’t be so great. Also some interesting ideas around the current oversharing culture, and how it can cause unexpected damage. I’ve already added _Crosstalk_&nbsp;to my “to read” list!

## [Zuckerberg in Africa][2]—Backchannel

Although I’m not a fan of Facebook, I think it’s great that Zuckerberg took time to schedule in a visit to Africa, as it’s one of the highest growth areas, both generally and technology-wise, for this century. I think the thing that impressed me most about this trip was that Zuckerberg wasn’t primarily visiting the leaders of the countries he visited, he spent a lot of time talking to the people creating in Africa.

## [Earth Temperature Timeline][3]—xkcd

As always Randall Munroe from [xkcd][4]&nbsp;hits the nail on it’s head with this comic exploring the temperature of the Earth over the last 22,000 years. It’s a great comic which is both entertaining and scares the hell out of you.&nbsp;

## [How To Eradicate One Of Our Deadliest Enemies – Gene Drive & Malaria][5]—Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell

Another great [Kurzgesagt][6]&nbsp;video exploring an interesting conundrum, discussing whether we should genetically modify mosquitos using [CRISPR][7]&nbsp;and Gene Drive to make them immune to Malaria (one of the most deadly viruses to humans). It’s an interesting debate, and one that will need to be resolved soon, as there have also been [experiments with sterilising mosquitos][8]&nbsp;causing the population to completely collapse. Which is worse, genetically modifying a species, or intentionally driving them to extinction?

## [Are E-sports Eating Up Traditional Sports Viewership?][9]—MIT Technology Review

An interesting theory posited by Jamie Condliffe, but I’m not surprised, I actually watch quite a lot of videos of people playing games. It’s also interesting that traditional sports teams are starting to acquire e-sports teams as well as e-sports scholarships cropping up. I guess the 21st Century really is the Revenge of the Nerds!
