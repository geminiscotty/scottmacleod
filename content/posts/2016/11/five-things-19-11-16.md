## [Human Population Through Time][1]—American Museum of Natural History

This is a very interesting visualisation, showing the spread of humans across the planet. It was very fitting for me to see this this week, as I’m currently listening to [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind][2]&nbsp;by Yuval Noah Harari which is a ridiculously interesting read.

## [Biology Enables. Culture Forbids.][3]—Farnam Street

This is the article which convinced me to read Sapiens, it explores the reality that if we can do it, by definition it is natural. Unnatural acts are designated by culture. And humans have a tendency to create narratives around the unnaturalness of certain acts or certain groups in society.

## [The Law of the Tongue: The Deal Between the Orcas and Whalers of Eden, Australia][4]—Today I Found Out

I think my favourite part of reading about history is discovering little gems like this. I think it’s fascinating that a pod of orcas learnt that they could save a lot of time and energy in hunting baleen whales by getting humans to help them. We definitely don’t give orcas the credit they deserve when it comes to their intelligence.

## [The Anti-Helicopter Parent’s Plea: Let Kids Play!][5]—The New York Times

A slightly controversial piece in this day and age, as physically based communities have been shrinking or breaking down completely, it’s good to see that some people are trying to make sure neighbourhoods where kids can play safely continue to exist. I recall the fun of my childhood being a time of exploring the town that I lived with my friends, and without parental supervision.

## [Why Supermarket Bacon Hides It’s Glorious Fat][6]—Bloomberg

A short one to finish of this weeks edition, a investigation into how the “shingle pack” came into being and the duality of making bacon look lean from the top of the package, and completely fatty from the bottom.
