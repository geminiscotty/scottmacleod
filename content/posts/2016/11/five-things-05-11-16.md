## <a target="_top" href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">The Mistake Smart People Make: Being In Motion vs. Taking Action</a>—James Clear

A short but interesting article exploring the difference between actually getting work done and doing work to feel busy. As always work without shipping isn’t worth much. To make sure you’re shipping I can suggest checking out James Clear’s other articles on the [Ivy Lee Method][1], and [Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy][2], which will help you prioritise the work to be done.

## [Immigrants Are Keeping America Young — And The Economy Growing][3]—FiveThirtyEight

An interesting analysis of how immigration is actually positively impacting the United States, with immigrants helping grow the economy while the native US population ages and retires. Sadly, it’s hard for most people to see the benefit of the many when they are losing out.

## [The Case Against Democracy][4]—The New Yorker

As we are coming up to the US Election, on Tuesday, it’s good to explore the validity of democracy. As explored in the article, one of democracy’s biggest weakness is that it relies on an _informed_electorate, making logical decisions. However, this is rarely the case.

There is much to be improved in a representative democracy, but it’s the best we have at the moment. As Winston Churchill said:

> “Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time…”

## [The Inevitability of Being Hacked][5]—The Atlantic

I can’t believe it took less than an hour for a hacking attempt to be run against the authors server! Again it shows that using default passwords for securing any device is inviting people to take control of your devices…

## [Patton Oswalt: “I’ll Never Be at 100 Percent Again”][6]—The New York Times

A truly touching story on Patton Oswalt’s journey through dealing with his wife’s sudden death.

I also wanted to share one more link this week, my friend Ben has put together and launched a great guide (including a 90-minute webinar) on how to get more work as a freelancer, make sure to check it out here:&nbsp;[FreelancerAlliance.com][7]
