## [Why we choose profit][1]—Signal v. Noise

A great article from Jason Fried, explaining how a focus on real profit leads to a truly valuable company. This is because a business that is profitable is flexible and ends up being simpler to run if you don’t need to worry about running out of money and convincing investors to give up their money.

## [How The New York Times Is Clawing Its Way Into the Future][2]—WIRED

It looks like the Gray Lady has a strong plan at ensuring it remains relevant and profitable in a digital future. It’s good to see that new blood has gone into the organisation and are willing to try things, and aren’t as concerned of making sure things are “Timesian” enough, which I’m sure has limited innovation in the past.&nbsp;

## [The little yellow box that’s made thousands of operations safer][3]—Mosaic

It’s great to hear that doctors in developed countries, are taking the time to travel to less developed countries, simply to take the time and money to make surgery safer for the people who go through it. It’s also amazing that one device is having such and impact, kudos to [Lifebox][4]&nbsp;for working to make the pulse oximeter as affordable as possible and providing training.

## [&#8216;I know they are going to die.&#8217; This foster father takes in only terminally ill children][5]—LA Times

I honestly don’t think I could ever do this. I think that it is great that Branson-Potts wrote this story about Bzeek, as his sacrifices should be celebrated. Anyone who is willing to dedicate their life to easing the passing of so many people is a hero in my book.

## [How the Anti-Vaxxers Are Winning][6]—The New York Times

This is one of the most disheartening pieces I’ve read in a long time. And is directly related to the absolutely crazy trend of the general public trusting an expert’s opinion. Many people would prefer to listen to [Robert De Niro’s][7]&nbsp;theories than scientists… This is insane.
