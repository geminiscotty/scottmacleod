## [I Used to Be a Human Being][1]—New York Magazine

If there is one piece out of these that you read, please let it be this one. Sullivan explores how the modern world has reduced our time for reflection. With the distractions available allowing us to hide from our feelings.

The availability of distraction is also what has had the biggest effect on religion. As we don&#8217;t need to address our spiritual pain when we have a Facebook notification to check.

One of the biggest issues I see is instances of being &#8220;alone together&#8221;. When you&#8217;re with someone, but your mind is elsewhere (often checking a feed). If you&#8217;re with someone, be with them. Otherwise it&#8217;s a waste of time for both of you.

## [This Is How War Begins][2]—Charles Eisenstein

I don’t want to put any current politics talk in this newsletter, yet this is such a good piece that I had to share it. Eisenstein explores how people react to opinions they disagree with. He notes, that the first reaction is often to dehumanise the person who wrote it.

When people see a group as less than human, they believe the group is unable to do things themselves. That leads to forced education, subjugation, or war.

Eisenstein follows that up with a way to stop it happening, but I’ll let you read in his words what to do.

## [Under One Roof: What Can we Learn from the Mayo Clinic?][3]—Farnam Street

A look at how the Mayo Clinic, continues to be the best and consolidated medical care systems in the world. They achieve this by making sure the incentives align with the organisation. And that it is a one stop shop for all medical needs.

Although specialists have their place, they should be a part of a larger organisation. This helps services clients better than if they need to go to many different places for one solution.

## [An Incubator for (Former) Drug Dealers][4]—Bloomberg Businessweek

It&#8217;s good to see that some people are thinking about what happens after a former inmate gets out. It&#8217;s a fantastic idea, creating an incubator. As former drug dealers often have issues finding legitimate work. Which often leads to them going back to dealing drugs.

It&#8217;s also good to see that it&#8217;s not a one off with two incubators talked about in the piece. One started by a former inmate, which is awesome.

## [Sherlock: How to Film Thought][5]—Nerdwriter

Nerdwriter does a great job analysing one 3 minute and 42 second sequence in the new season of Sherlock. It explores how the creators of Sherlock communicate the thought process of Holmes.

If you haven’t watched Sherlock, watch it. It’s one of the best put together shows of recent years.&nbsp;[Nerdwriter][6]&nbsp;is a great channel if you’re looking for fascinating video essays.
