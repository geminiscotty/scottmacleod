## [5 Things That Should Be Taught in Every School][1]—Mark Manson

I completely agree with Mark Manson on this. The current education system in most of the countries of the world is broken. In a world where there is so many subjects that can be learnt, schools need to teach individuals how to learn, and how to function in society.

The current system of rote memorisation is a waste of time now we have access to all the information in the world a Google Search away. The most value mandatory education could provide is to give children a method of exploring their interests outside of school, and the ability to evaluate the information they find.

## [Young people and free speech][2]—The Economist

In my opinion, this is one of the most worrying trends I’ve seen in the support of civil liberties of recent times (and this is in an era of massive state-sponsored surveillance). The right to free speech allows people to voice their discontent with the world, without that right people will be punished for having a dissenting opinion.

As Lee Rowland from the ACLU [explained to NPR][3], you may not agree with someones viewpoint, but in the context of free speech you don’t need to. They still have a right to speak their mind, otherwise if everyone outside of the popular belief is censured, all the dystopian books start playing out.

## [Mr. Money Mustache — Living Beautifully on $25-27K Per Year][4]—The Tim Ferriss Show

This is a great interview with Pete Adeney (aka Mr. Money Mustache), and explores a variety of topics, including: how you should build something with your own hands at least once, how running your own investments can be a huge waste of time, and the importance of human locomotion.

## [When Evidence Says No, but Doctors Say Yes][5]—The Atlantic

A very interesting read/listen, exploring how medical practices continue despite their efficacy being disproven. While I don’t have a solid answer on a way to fix this, I think it’s an important discussion to have when some disproved treatments have a chance of causing harm.

Another interesting part of this article explores how there is, by far, more emphasis placed on “making a discovery’ than replicating the study. This is broken though, as the scientific method relies on studies being replicated to ensure that the science is good, rather than a one off fluke or a fabrication.

## [Sand mining: the global environmental crisis you’ve probably never heard of][6]—The Guardian

It’s amazing that this is happening at a huge scale, yet I hadn’t heard anything about it until it was mentioned in a video I watched a few weeks ago! I think this is going to be one of the biggest short-term environmental issues we’ll see.
