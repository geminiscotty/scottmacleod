## [Life on a Ledge][1]—Chicago Sun-Times

A pretty emotional piece exploring a wide variety of peoples reactions to a public suicide, including people who did know the person who jumped, and people who just witnessed it. It’s interesting to see how people deal with being involved in such a shocking event.  
 

## [Scott Pilgrim: Make Your Transitions Count][2]—The NerdWriter

A great exploration of the importance of transitions in film, through the lens of one of my favourite movies. The NerdWriter gives a variety of examples of ways that transitions can effect how we interpret sequences, and how it can be obvious or subtle to try and effect our reactions.  
 

## [Half a House][3]—99% Invisble

For the architecture and city planning geeks out there, this is a fantastic episode. The 99% Invisible team explores how an architecture firm worked out how to create housing for as many people as possible on a limited budget: they built half houses. The genius part of this though is that they gave the residents the ability to expand the houses themselves.

[Another quick read from 99% Invisible][4]&nbsp;over the last week explores the ingenious education plan that the Dutch put in place to avoid cyclists getting doored.  
 

## [MailChimp and the Un-Silicon Valley Way to Make It as a Start-Up][5]—The New York Times

A great little piece exploring one of my favourite companies (the email you’re reading now was sent using MailChimp), and how they didn’t follow the “typical” technology startup route. I’m personally a fan of bootstrapping a business rather than funding a business via venture capital, as I believe it builds a better, longer lasting business.  
 

## Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning—Viktor E. Frankl

Typically I don’t suggest books here, however Man’s Search for Meaning is both quite short and is a pretty hard hitting book. It explores Frankl’s time in concentration camps during World War II, and explores the psychology of the Jewish prisoners, including himself. I personally think it should be on everyone’s reading lists if you haven’t read it before.

I can also suggest the [Audible version of the book][6]&nbsp;($14.11), as Simon Vance does a great job giving voice to those who did and didn’t survive.
