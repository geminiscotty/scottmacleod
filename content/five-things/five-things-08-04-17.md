If you’ve ever been interested in how the technology of early humans was made and what the uses were, I have the YouTube channel for you!&nbsp;[Primitive Technology][2]&nbsp;is a fascinating and relaxing watch, as the guy making the items doesn’t speak, so it’s just the sounds of his actions and the sounds of North Queensland rainforest.
