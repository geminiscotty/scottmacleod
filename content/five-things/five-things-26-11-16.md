## [Can Hypothermia Save Gunshot Victims?][1]—The New Yorker

It’s interesting that a technique that has the strong potential to save people’s lives is hit with so much controversy… I think Peter Safa and Sam Tisherman should be commended for pushing forward against the controversy for decades to get to the human trail stage.

## [TITANPOINTE: The NSA’s Spy Hub in New York, Hidden in Plain Sight][2]—The Intercept

Why hiding in plain sight is sometimes the best option, a look inside a well regarded skyscraper that has existed on the New York skyline for decades.

If you interested in surveillance and related topics, The Intercept is a great source, another interesting story is about the [U.K. Parliament approving the Investigatory Powers Bill][3]&nbsp;(the “Snoopers’ Charter” according to critics).

## [No Cause for Alarm: Dynamic Sprinkler-Free System Stops Fires Before They Start][4]—99% Invisible

An interesting solution to stop fires! Of course it’s pretty hard to maintain in many environments. But is a brilliant idea for storage archives/warehouses, and server farms. It’s a great idea to use the air to stop fires, since completely fills up the spare space.

## [The Last Unknown Man][5]—New Republic

The past often defines us, but what if you didn’t have a past. This story explores the story of a man who was found behind a Burger King, and didn’t know who he was. It’s a long but very interesting story, also exploring the rise of identification, and how in the age of the internet it’s getting a lot harder to be truly unknown.

## [What a driverless world could look like][6]—TED

This is a world I can get behind, the irony being that the more automated by computers our cities become (especially traffic) the more organic they’ll behave.
