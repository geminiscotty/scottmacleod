title: Podcasts That Help Me Be A Better Man

Recently, I’ve heavily cut back on the podcasts I listen to, as I’ve been reading when commuting, so the only time I have to listen is mainly when I’m exercising. And since the podcasts I enjoy are often longer than an hour, sometimes a podcast can last multiple sessions.

Recently, I’ve taken my self improvement interest into the podcast realm, and have come to listen to three podcasts regularly that I feel improve myself. They are:

# The Art of Manliness

This podcast is a companion to the website, [The Art of Manliness](http://www.artofmanliness.com/), which has many tips for people who are looking to improve themselves in many different ways. The podcast also takes this on board with episodes on [“Deep Work”(http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/01/12/podcast-168-the-value-of-deep-work-in-the-age-of-distraction/)], [Stoic philosophy](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/10/31/podcast-151-the-way-of-the-stoic-warrior/), and [digital etiquette](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/12/11/podcast-162-digital-manners-etiquette-for-the-modern-man/).

I feel that the wide and varied interviews that appear in the Art of Manliness feed are very beneficial for all people, males and females. Sure, [wet shaving](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/09/18/podcast-139-the-secrets-of-shaving/) may not be 100% useful for all people, but having an understanding of many of the skills that are talked about, will improve many people’s lives.

# The Tim Ferriss Show

If you haven’t read a [Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) book, I’d be very surprised, as Ferriss has become a large personality in the self-improvement sector. His podcast generally shifts away from the very direct action style of his books to more of a interview show with people who interest and inspire him.

This leads to a very interesting mix of people on the Tim Ferriss Podcast. He has has interviewed a huge variety of people from authors such as: [Seth Godin](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/), [Sophia Amoruso](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/10/13/the-nasty-icon-of-retail-sophia-amoruso/) (the author of [#GIRLBOSS(https://www.bookdepository.com/Girlboss-Sophi-Amoruso/9780241217931?a_aid=scottmacleod)]) and [Maria Popova(http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/24/maria-popova-starting-a-successful-blog/)] (the prolific writer of [Brianpickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/)); to entertainers such as: [Jamie Foxx](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/06/jamie-foxx/), [Triple H](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/04/20/triple-h/), and [Arnold Schwarzenegger](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/02/arnold-schwarzenegger/).

Some of my favourite episodes have been with: [Jamie Foxx](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/06/jamie-foxx/), [Seth Godin](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/), [Pavel Tsatsouline](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/01/15/pavel-tsatsouline/), [Tony Robbins](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/10/15/money-master-the-game/), [Ed Catmull](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/12/ed-catmull/) (co-founder of Pixar), and [Sam Harris](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/06/18/sam-harris/) (who we’ll get to very shortly).

In a very short time, the Tim Ferriss Show has become one of my most listened to podcasts, as Ferriss is very good a coaxing out interesting tidbits from his guests.

# Waking Up with Sam Harris

Waking Up is a very interesting podcast being a mix of interviews Sam Harris with his guests, a series of monologues that Harris has about a variety of different subjects, and a series of Ask Me Anything’s which can cover an even larger array of topics. However this mashes together into a interesting feed, which makes me think a lot more than normal.

Some of the topics that Harris has covered include: the [conflict in Israel](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/why-dont-i-criticize-israel), the [benefit of hallucinogens in regards to spirituality](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/drugs-and-the-meaning-of-life), and chats with [ex-Seals about the nature of violence](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/the-logic-of-violence).

Again I believe the wide variety of topics covered by Harris help inform me beyond most traditional media, making sure I understand a variety of view points and know a topic more deeply than before.

So that’s my top three podcasts I feel make me a better person. I invite you to listen them to yourself and see what they do for you.

Let me know what you think of them, and feel free to let me know of any other podcasts you believe make you a better person.
