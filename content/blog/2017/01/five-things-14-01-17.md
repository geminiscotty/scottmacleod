## [Embrace the Mess: The Upside of Disorder][1]—Farnam Street Blog

If you feel like you spend all your time and effort organising things instead of creating, perhaps you should stop organising things. That’s the idea explored in this article. For example, research has shown that relying on your email search is on average a lot faster to find the email you’re looking for rather than going through meticulously organises email folders.

I’ve already ordered Tim Harford’s new book [Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives][2], which is what this article is based on.

## [Secrets of the Watchtower][3]—Reveal

It truly is surprising how far religious groups will go to protect child abusers within their congregation. This stories explores how the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ methods of silencing people has ended up being a part of being a part of the community.

Be warned this is an intense episode. But I believe it’s important to listen to to realise that large corporations and religions are very good at covering things up at any cost.

## [The Downside of Work-Life Balance][4]—James Clear

A great explanation of the “Four Burner Theory” (also known as the “Four Lightbulb Theory”), where one’s life is represented by a stove with four burners on it, each representing: your family, your friends, your health, and your work.&nbsp;

> The Four Burners Theory says that “in order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two.

James explores some ideas on how you could push each burner a little more in the time you have, and some ideas on how you can prioritise certain burners at different points in your life.

## [Is sugar the world’s most popular drug?][5]—The Guardian

The history of sugar is quite interesting, especially with happens like the sales of sweets increasing throughout the US Great Depression! Some interesting arguments on the impact of sugar, and I do hope that because of the press around Gary Taubes new book, more research into the effects of sugar get funded.

## [Distractions are a Nuisance, but Infinity Pools are the Real Problem][6]—Time Dorks

Some great points about how time can be drained completely by “Infinity Pools” i.e. the places on the internet were you can continue to receive more and more information. These are the places we go to when we’re bored, to get that hit of dopamine, not realising that we’re getting addicted.
