## [Information Density &#8211; How Mr. Robot Does a Lot with a Little][1]—Extra Credits

An interesting look at how media creators can use information density to help the consumers of the media, instead of telling them what happens, complete the scene themselves. Making a better piece overall. It’s explored through the lens of one of Mr. Robot’s more intense episodes. On that note, if you haven’t watched Mr. Robot, stop reading and watch it now. It is the most perfectly written, shot, and acted TV show I have watched, absolutely everything has been considered by the production team, and it shows.

## [We Are All Confident Idiots][2]—Pacific Standard

This is a really interesting piece on how our perception of our own knowledge has a dramatic effect on our willingness to comment on and believe things that have not basis in facts. This can also lead to agreeing with two statements that overall contradict themselves, because the statements themselves fall into our beliefs. This is a fascinating read, and may help you to look at your own beliefs to see if you should have them or not, I know I will be.

> “Incompetent people do not recognize — scratch that, cannot recognize — just how incompetent they are, a phenomenon that has come to be known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. Logic itself almost demands this lack of self-insight: For poor performers to recognize their ineptitude would require them to possess the very expertise they lack.”

## [The Vertical Farm][3]—The New Yorker

Vertical farms are actually one of the most interesting developments in the last decade, and I believe that they’ll have a massive impact, economically, health-wise, and environmentally. This story gives a good overview of the process of vertical farming, and even explores the benefits that it can have in a educational situation, although I’m sure industrialised farmers won’t like it, I’m sure the benefits outweigh the costs.

## [Finland trials basic income for unemployed][4]—The Guardian

I don’t have a lot to say about this one, but it’s going to be interesting to watch. I personally prefer the sound of Utrecht’s version mentioned in this article, with incentives around doing volunteer work. Overall, I hope that basic income is balanced to keep people out of poverty, but not completely comfortable. As I think citizens still need to put effort towards the GDP, otherwise we’ll end up with a lot of people with a lot of spare time on their hands.

## [Top 10 Tech Trends Transforming Humanity][5]—Peter Diamandis

Although it was a very mixed year politically and socially for quite a few people, 2016 was a awesome year for science and technology! From solar becoming cheaper than coal to making huge strides towards curing cancer, 2016 was a massive year, I cannot wait to see what stuff will be created in 2017!
