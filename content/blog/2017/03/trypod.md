There is a new campaign on Twitter to share podcasts under the [#trypod hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trypod). I thought this was a great idea so I wanted to share my top 3 podcasts that everyone should listen to!

## 99% Invisible

If you're looking to try podcasts but you’re not sure where to start, start here. 99% Invisible is one of the top podcasts on everyone’s lists, thanks to the combination of fantastic reporting, the exploration of the things we don’t usually think about, and Roman Mars’ soothing voice.

If you’re not sure where to start, there is no better place than at [Episode 1 “99% Noise”](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/99-invisible-01-99-noise-by-roman-mars-this/). But other standout episodes include:

## The Tim Ferriss Show

Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of podcasting, and it’s a title well earned. Over the years of running The Tim Ferriss Show, his interviewing skills have grown substantially! His skill is in teasing out interesting stories that the people who come on the show (who often have given a lot of interviews) that have never been told before.

Some great episodes to try include:

- [How to Design a Life – Debbie Millman](http://tim.blog/2017/01/12/how-to-design-a-life-debbie-millman/)
- [Seth Godin on How to Think Small to Go Big](http://tim.blog/2016/08/03/seth-godin-on-how-to-think-small-to-go-big/)
- [Dissecting the Success of Malcolm Gladwell](http://tim.blog/2016/06/21/malcolm-gladwell/)
- [Mr. Money Mustache — Living Beautifully on $25-27K Per Year](http://tim.blog/2017/02/13/mr-money-mustache/)
- [Jocko Willink on Discipline, Leadership, and Overcoming Doubt](https://tim.blog/2016/09/21/jocko-willink-on-discipline-leadership-and-overcoming-doubt/)

## Song Exploder

Hrishikesh Hirway has done a great job creating an amazing podcast that I didn’t know I needed until I heard it. Hirway interviews musicians across a wide array of genres and gets them to explain how they came to certain decisions about what went into the final track.

Here are the ones that I found most interesting:

- [Young Folks - Peter Bjorn and John](https://overcast.fm/itunes863897795/the-tim-ferriss-show)
- [Kill V. Maim - Grimes](http://songexploder.net/grimes)
- [Time to Pretend - MGMT](http://songexploder.net/mgmt)
- [Game of Thrones (Main Title Theme) - Ramin Djawadi](http://songexploder.net/ramin-djawadi)
- [The District Sleeps Alone Tonight - The Postal Service](http://songexploder.net/the-postal-service)
