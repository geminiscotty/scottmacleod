title: 2016 — A Year of Change

Just a warning before we get started: This post is a bit aspirational, so if you’re not interested in it feel free to skip this one.

For me 2016 is going to be a year of change. Although over the last few years I’ve made many changes that have improved my life for the better, there is still much room for improvement. I’ve identified a few areas where I think I can improve which will bring significant changes to my life.

## Fitness

I’ve never been a particularly fit individual, starting as a bookworm at a young age and transitioning to video games and movies as I got older. I spent a lot more time looking at other people’s active lifestyles instead of living my own.

So this year I’ve decided that I’m sick of not liking what I see in the mirror and I will be making some changes. These changes include: changing my diet away from the junk I’ve been eating over the last year to more home-cooked and natural meals, and I’ll also be taking up strength training, as well as my bike riding, to morph my body into something that is strong, capable and looks good.

As a part of this I have put away my TV and Xbox One for at least the first 3 months of the year, as a way of both giving myself time to exercise and cook, and to do other improvement activities such as:

## Educational

My educational goal for 2016 is to increase the rate of my book reading. Over the past couple of months I’ve dived head first into reading again and I have been enjoying it immensely, however, I’ve been disappointed in the rate that I have been reading.

So my plan with all the free time I’ve gained from not watching TV or playing game, I will be aiming to get through a book at least every fortnight. This I hope will help bring new ideas into my life and will help inspire some new posts on here.

## Skills

There are two skills that I’d like to improve this year: number one is my cooking skills, especially around coming up with dishes based on what I have on hand. The added benefit of it helping with my fitness goals (as long as I avoid baking).

The second skill I’d like to improve, is what I’m doing right now in writing this post: I’d like to write more and get a lot better at it. Communication is one of the most important skills in this time, and while I’m quite adept at communicating by talking it out, I have a lot to go when it comes to writing.

## Finance

My final goal for 2016 is that I’d like to get a solid handle on my finances. One way I’ve already started doing that is by following one of the tenants explained in The Richest Man in Babylon, which is to pay yourself 10% of whatever you earn.

The second prong will be once I’ve payed myself enough to start investing it, both in the traditional sense, and by investing the money in experiences for myself.

Later in the year, one of saving goals will be to sell as many of the things I own as possible and then try to stick with a much more minimal life than I have been living.

So that wraps up my big goals for 2016. I hope it inspires some of you to have a look at what you plan to do with your life in 2016 and beyond. If you’d like to discuss anything please feel free to get in touch, and I wish you a interesting and fulfilling new year!
